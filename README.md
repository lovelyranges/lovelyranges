Hello! My name is Lovely and I am a fourth year, undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University doing my Bachelor of Arts in Communications & Social Data Analytics. My academic interests are how communication technologies can affect media democracy, the impact of fake news and disinformation on the general public, as well as recognizing the exploitative conditions that exist behind such advanced technologies. I am a hobbyist programmer, passionate about learning more on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) in general.

Thanks for checking out my page :)
